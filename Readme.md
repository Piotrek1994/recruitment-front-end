## How to start
Download all repository files to your github profile by using fork functionality or by just download/upload files. Your repository should be public. If you do some more commits than only one "all changes" it will be a plus :)

All functionalities should be coded in pure JS (vanilla js) with ES6 standard.


## Installation

To run task use commands below:

```bash
  cd recruitment-front-end
  npm install
```


## Usage
To run app in local server use command:
```bash
npm run dev
```
It will open browser automatically and point to localhost:3000. Webpack has hot reload so all changes in code will cause reloading the page.

When you end creating code use command:
```bash
npm run build
```
To create distribution package.
